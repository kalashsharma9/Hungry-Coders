# 8 Fix the invalid variable names in the code below. Python follows similar rules: variables can contain letters, numbers, and _, but cannot start with numbers, contain hyphens, or use reserved words.



# 2nd_item = 50         #  Starts with a number
# item-price = 30       #  Hyphen is not allowed
# class = "Math"        #  'class' is a reserved keyword


second_item = 50      #  Use letters or underscores, not digits at the beginning
item_price = 30       #  Use underscore instead of hyphen
class_name = "Math"   #  Avoid reserved words like 'class'
