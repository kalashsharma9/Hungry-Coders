#  3 Create two versions of the number 100: one as an integer and one as a string. Show the difference by displaying their types and what happens when you try to add them.

# Create variables
num_int = 100        # Integer
num_str = "100"      # String

# Display their values and types
print("num_int:", num_int, "| Type:", type(num_int))
print("num_str:", num_str, "| Type:", type(num_str))

# Try to add them
try:
    result = num_int + num_str
    print("Result of addition:", result)
except TypeError as e:
